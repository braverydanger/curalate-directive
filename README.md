curalate-directive
==================

From terminal, run: 
node app.js 

this will create a simple server at http://localhost:9000


The curalate script must be on the page. 

The only script change should be made:
** templateUrl: '/app/templates/curalate/instagram.html'
from here you need to edit the template URL. You may need to inject the app settings into the directive.
